Bug Triage Agent – AI-Powered Defect Analysis and Assignment Assistant

Bug Triage Agent is an intelligent multi-agent system built using CrewAI that automates the initial defect triage process by analyzing bug reports, identifying probable root causes, assessing severity and priority, and recommending the most suitable assignee or team for resolution.

The agent leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), project knowledge bases, historical defect data, application documentation, and test execution results to provide consistent and data-driven triage decisions.

Key Capabilities
1. Automated Bug Analysis
Reads bug descriptions, logs, screenshots, stack traces, and test results.
Extracts critical information from defect reports.
Identifies affected modules and functionalities.
2. Severity and Priority Recommendation
Evaluates business impact and technical impact.
Suggests Severity (Critical, Major, Minor, etc.).
Recommends Priority (P1, P2, P3, etc.).
Reduces subjective decision-making during triage meetings.
3. Root Cause Prediction
Analyzes defect patterns and historical issues.
Predicts likely causes such as:
UI defect
Backend issue
API failure
Configuration issue
Environment issue
Data-related issue
4. Intelligent Assignment Recommendation
Identifies the most relevant developer or team.
Uses module ownership and historical defect resolution data.
Reduces reassignment cycles.
5. Duplicate Defect Detection
Compares new defects against historical defects.
Flags potential duplicates.
Helps reduce defect backlog noise.
6. Risk and Impact Assessment
Identifies affected business areas.
Predicts regression risks.
Suggests impacted test suites.
7. Knowledge Base Integration
Connects with:
Jira
Confluence
Test Management Tools
Historical Defect Repositories
Requirement Documents
8. Triage Summary Generation

Automatically generates:

Bug Summary
